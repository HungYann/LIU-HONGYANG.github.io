遇到的主要问题是，idea无法在远程连接的虚拟机上产生数据，消费者在console上也无法打印消息。经过自强大哥的指导，应该是`server.properties`文件配置错误。
以下步骤为更新重新配置的过程，

1.首先在`conf/server.properties`中，修改listeners

![](https://tva1.sinaimg.cn/large/e6c9d24ely1gzwny44b8ij212u07ota4.jpg)

修改后为本机的ip地址，本机ip地址通过`ip addr`命令查看，这个例子就是`172.18.2.39`，端口号不变。

2.找到zookeepr的配置，

在这里配置的地址也是该ip地址，并且加了一个kafka目录后缀，单独创建，主要是为了便于维护。

3.接着就是重启kafka了，因为用了supervisor进程管理，因此只需要 `supervisor reload kafka`即可，
如果重启报错，就需要使用删除log.dirs目录，用rm -rf删除即可。

4.此时就可以创建一个新的主题了，

创建命令如下，需要注意的是zookeeper的地址和目录，
```shell
./bin/kafka-topics.sh --create --zookeeper 172.18.2.39:2181/kafka --replication-factor 1 --partitions 1 --topic test2
```

5.在使用前我们先测试一下,

执行 如下命令
```shell
./bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list 172.18.2.39:9092 --topic test2
```

打印几条消息

6.最后通过consumer消费, 注意需要加上`--from-beginning`，查看所有数据
```shell
./bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server 172.18.2.39:9092 --topic test2 --from-beginning
```

7.最后一步就是运行java代码，打印消息。



java连接代码：

```java
package demo01;

import org.apache.kafka.clients.producer.KafkaProducer;
import org.apache.kafka.clients.producer.ProducerConfig;
import org.apache.kafka.clients.producer.ProducerRecord;
import org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringSerializer;

import java.util.Properties;

public class CustomProducer {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // 配置
        Properties properties = new Properties();
        // 连接集群
        properties.put(ProducerConfig.BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS_CONFIG,"172.18.2.39:9092");
        // 指定对应key和value序列化
        properties.put(ProducerConfig.KEY_SERIALIZER_CLASS_CONFIG, StringSerializer.class.getCanonicalName());
        properties.put(ProducerConfig.VALUE_SERIALIZER_CLASS_CONFIG, StringSerializer.class.getCanonicalName());
        //创建kafka生产对象
        KafkaProducer kafkaProducer = new KafkaProducer<>(properties);
        //发送数据
        kafkaProducer.send(new ProducerRecord<>("test2", "tee2222111"));
        //关闭资源
        kafkaProducer.close();
    }
}

```

#    2. Latency: Very large flush intervals may lead to latency spikes when the flush does occur as there will be a lot of data to flush.
#    3. Throughput: The flush is generally the most expensive operation, and a small flush interval may lead to excessive seeks.
# The settings below allow one to configure the flush policy to flush data after a period of time or
# every N messages (or both). This can be done globally and overridden on a per-topic basis.

# The number of messages to accept before forcing a flush of data to disk
