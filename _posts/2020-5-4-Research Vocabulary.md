```
in this paper, we firstly address the issue of detecting spammers on Twitter. To do it, we propose a 4-step approach. First, we crawled a near-complete dataset from Twitter. To do it,we propose a 4-step approach. First, we crawled a near-complete dataset from Twitter, comtaining more than 54 million users, 1.9 billion links, and almost 1.8 billion tweets.

Second, we created a labeled collection with users "manully" classified as spammers and non-spammers. Third we conducted a study about the characteristics of tweet content and users behavviour on Twitter aiming at understanding their relative discriminative power to distinguish spammers and non-spammers. Lastly, we investigate the feasibility of applying a superivised machine learning method to identify spammmers.
