> SQL SELECT 



asterisk(*)可能就影响效率



```sql
select employee_id, first_name,last_name,hire_date
from employees;
```



The `DATEDIFF()` function returns the difference in days between the hire date and the current date.

The `FLOOR()` function returns the largest integer less than or equal the result of a numeric expression.

```sql
select 
	employee_id, 
	first_name, 
	last_name,
	FLOOR(DATEDIFF('2016-01-01',hire_date)/365) YOS
FROM 
	employees;

```



```sql
SELECT CURRENT_DATE - hire_date as interval from employees;
```



> SQL ORDER BY



```sql
SELECT
	employee_id,
	first_name,
	last_name,
	hire_date,
	salary
FROM
	employees
ORDER BY
	employee_id;
```



> DISTINCT examples



```sql
SELECT DISTINCT
	salary
FROM
	employees
ORDER BY
	salary DESC;
```
