**什么是并行计算？**

"Solve a single problem by using multiple processors(i.e. core) working together"

 In parallel computing, use multiple computer resources to solve a computational problem

 

Different between parallel computing & distributed computing?

 

 Parallel Computing ...

 

- Means different activities happened at the same time
- Spread out a single application over many cores/processors/precesses to get it done bigger or faster
- Mostly used in scientific computing

 

Distrubuted computing...

 

- Activities across systems or distanced servers
- Focus more on concurrency and resource sharing
- From the business/ commercial world

 

分散式系统通常坐落在全世界各地，共享资料，目的是沟通，分享资料，云端计算的兴起，网络不好，系统不好会很难用，

很小的device,都会被连接在一起，

通过Internet取得计算资源和计算服务

独立的manage 但是cooperate和share计算资源

 

共同资源在于involve计算资源，但是目的和计算系统不同

Parallel computing is an evolution of serial computing that attempts to emulate what has always been the state of affairs in the natural world

并行计算是串行计算的进化，它试图模拟自然界中一直存在的状态

 

 

 

 

**为什么需要并行计算？**

Save time

- Use more resources to shorten execution with potential cost saving
- Shorter exectution time allows more runs or more tunning opportunity

**并行计算机与并行模型的分类**

 

Hardware:

Flynn's classic taxonomy

Memory architecture classification

Software:

Programming model classification

 

*Flynn's classic taxonomy*

From the process unit prospective: Classify computer architecture based two independent dimensions: Instruction & Data

SISD Single Instruction Single Data

SIMD Single Instruction Multiple Data

MISD Muliple Instruction Single Data

MIMD Multiple Instruciton Multiple Data

 

*What makes it a supercomputer?*

 

All the latest hardware technologies 

Customized system configurations

Optimized software and libraries

Huge amount of cost in money and energy
