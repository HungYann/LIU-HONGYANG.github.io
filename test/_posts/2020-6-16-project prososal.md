**Research Title: **



Data analytics for dececting the fraud recruitment postings.



>  Problem statement:



Nowadays, the recruitment data has been gererated from the  job hunting websites. 



instructions







Nowadays, People are likely to utilize these websites to find more valuable  jobs. While it's not easy for most job seekers to get the useful the information from the huge volume of data. Most of the  people feel interested with the salary of the job. However, the impact on the job salary is still a mysterious, we would like to use recruitment data to find out the relationships between the job descriptions and the job salary. more competitive.



They have to understand the jargons descripted in the job description and match their skills to the companies' demands.



With the increasing number of job opportunities appearing on the Internet, people have to find a job opportunity from different job hunting websites. 



 People have to login the job websites and then use different attributes to sort the results to get their desired and high salary job. Consequently, 

However,  this way is insufficient to find a suitable job from massive job data. 

And, the number of potential job opportunities is massive, it’s inefficient to check the job description one by one and compare them to discover a job opportunity. 



>  Purpose statement:







> Research Out:



To achieve our objective, we will crawl the data from job market websites or collect some public data resources from Kaggle. And then we will use these data for data analysis. Finally, we will build a job visualization system to help job seekers to discover latent job opportunities.





> Tools:





Python for NLP processing

Plotly for data visualization
